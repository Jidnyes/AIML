AI & ML INTERNSHIP
Hints/Mini Guide:
1.Import the dataset and explore basic info (nulls, data types).
2.Handle missing values using mean/median/imputation.
3.Convert categorical features into numerical using encoding.
4.Normalize/standardize the numerical features.
5.Visualize outliers using boxplots and remove them.
Interview Questions:
1.What are the different types of missing data?
2.How do you handle categorical variables?
3.What is the difference between normalization and standardization?
4.How do you detect outliers?
5.Why is preprocessing important in ML?
6.What is one-hot encoding vs label encoding?
7.How do you handle data imbalance?
8.Can preprocessing affect model accuracy?
Dataset: You can use any dataset relevant to the task, e.g., Titanic Dataset
